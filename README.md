FCSNet: Feature Cross Shrinkage Network for Camouflaged Object Detection
Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), which focuses on segmenting visually ambiguous objects seamlessly embedded in their surroundings, has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, the precise delineation of boundary regions between camouflaged targets and background remains a critical challenge in this field. To address this fundamental limitation, we present a novel Feature Cross Shrinkage Network (FCSNet) featuring four key innovations: 1) An Edge-Aware Module (EAM) that explicitly extracts boundary cues from shallow feature maps to establish geometric constraints; 2) A dual-stream Edge-Mask Guidance Module (EMGM) that synergistically refines feature representations through joint edge prediction and mask supervision; 3) A Frequency-Spatial Feature Enhancement Module (FSFEM) that employs multi-scale receptive fields and frequency domain analysis to enhance discriminative feature learning; and 4) A hierarchical Feature Cross Shrinkage Decoder (FCSD) that enables progressive feature fusion through forward cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework uniquely integrates spatial-frequency analysis with boundary-aware learning, establishing a new paradigm for handling complex camouflage scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations across four benchmark datasets (CHAMELEON, CAMO, COD10K, and NC4K) demonstrate that FCSNet outperforms 26 state-of-the-art methods, achieving average gains of  +1.5% (Sα), +3.1% (Eϕ), and +8.4% (Fβ)  over the baseline FSPNet. Particularly noteworthy are the significant improvements in boundary localization accuracy, as evidenced by our detailed edge quality analysis. 

The codes will be released after the paper accepted.
